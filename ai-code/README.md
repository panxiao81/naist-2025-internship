# Some code that I wrote when I was training AI

Check `train.ipynb` Notebook is just fine. I run this training code on 1 NVIDIA A100 40G

`train.py` is basicly the same.

I don't update original documentation files, If you want to try out, Please download training data in markdown file and place it in `docs` dictionary.

For CUDA machine using CUDA 12.1, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Other code is some learning code, you can ignore it.
